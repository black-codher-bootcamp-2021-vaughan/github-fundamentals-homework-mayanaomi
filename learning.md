# What ive learnt so far :computer:
## Introducton into software development
the product development lifecycle- which involved 
###### Planning *concieving* :arrow_right: ###### Analysis *Specifying* :arrow_right: ###### Design :arrow_right: ###### Implementation *Programming* :arrow_right:###### Testing *Intergration* :arrow_right: ###### Maintainance *bug fixing*

###### Methodologies

The most common methodologies are agile- more modern and waterfall- most traditional

###### Possible tech careers
such as Front end developer, back end developer, full stack developer, Devops engenieer, Scrummaster, web developers, mobile developers
The programs which they have to use varies but some of the most common languages are Javascript, Java, HTML

#### source control
Source control is also known as version control
Its the process of tracking and managing changes to source code
*Source code = very first version of code*
Allows to make regular backups and identify different changes

## Command line + Git :bulb:
Can easily google commands if unsure
Every space and every character matters
Use arrow keys to navigate
Interrupt commands running using ctrl + C
Most times if commands are successful there will be no output message
But if commands are unsuccessful or incorrect, the output with be some form of an error message.
 *Command scripts*
 Series of plain script commands
 Can add comments to scripts using # this will be greyed out- This is to help humans to understand the intention of the code
 
I have learnt Basic command line- I've learnt how to create new directories, files, make a folder a git folder on my mac
The root drectory is the first location in the terminal window when opened
Never put a space when typing a word to want together
Use dash or underscore i.e BlackCodher = black-codher or black_codher

making a root directory `mkdir`
Finding the directory (Print Working Directory) `pwd`
To actually get into a directory `cd`
To come out of the directory `cd ..`
Creating a file `touch`
Moving a file (move) `mv` name of file Where you want to move it to
To open VS code `code .`
Show the content of a file (Just prints the text) `cat` file name*
List the content of a directory `Ls` name of folder
To delete a file (permanently deletes)  `rm file name`
To delete a directory `rm -R file name`
To print text `echo command "*** text ***"`
To clear screen `clear`
To clear previous line `ctrl + L`

### Git + Git Hub :keyboard: :lock_with_ink_pen:
I learnt more commands for git as well as how to create a remote git repository, how to create branches, chane branches and merge branches to main branch
Some basic Git commands are:
```
git help
git help add
git status
git add .
git commit -m
git init
git branch 
git checkout -b
git merge
git push origin main
git pull origin main

```

## What i am confused about :monocle_face:
I'm still a bit confused about the ins and outs of a repository,branches, and pulling a request online
also how to use git hub but i'm sure that with more practice i will get my head around git hub
